# Customer_Behavior_Analaysis

Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Analysis
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, analysis, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights using industry-standard tools commonly used by data analysts.
The project includes Python-based data analysis, SQL querying on a MySQL server, interactive dashboard development in Power BI, and final reporting through written documentation and presentation slides.
