# Customer_Behavior_Analaysis

Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Analysis

Overview:

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, analysis, visualization, and reporting. 
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights using industry-standard tools commonly used by data analysts.

The project includes Python-based data analysis, SQL querying on a MySQL server, interactive dashboard development in Power BI, 
and final reporting through written documentation and presentation slides.

Project Steps:-

1.	Data Loading
o	Imported the dataset into Python using pandas.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Reviewed dataset structure and summary statistics.
o	Identified trends, outliers, and distributions.
o	Analyzed customer demographics and purchase behavior.

3.	Data Cleaning & Preparation  
o	Handled missing values.
o	Standardized column names.
o	Performed feature engineering (age groups, customer segments).
o	Ensured data consistency.

4.	SQL Analysis (MySQL)   
o	Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.
