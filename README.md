# Customer_Behavior_Analaysis
Overview:
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, analysis, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights using industry-standard tools commonly used by data analysts.

The project includes Python-based data analysis, SQL querying on a MySQL server, interactive dashboard development in Power BI, and final reporting through written documentation and presentation slides.

Dataset:
Type: Customer transaction / shopping behavior data
Records: ~3,900 rows

Features:
Customer demographics (age, gender, location, subscription status)
Purchase details (category, item, amount, season, discounts)
Behavioral metrics (purchase frequency, reviews, shipping type)
The dataset contains minor missing values that were handled during data cleaning.

Tools & Technologies:
Python: Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
SQL (MySQL): Business analysis using structured queries
Power BI: Interactive dashboard and visual storytelling
Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation
Jupyter Notebook: Python analysis environment

Project Steps:
1.Data Loading
2.Imported the dataset into Python using pandas.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4.Reviewed dataset structure and summary statistics.
5.Identified trends, outliers, and distributions.
6.Analyzed customer demographics and purchase behavior.

Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Handled missing values.
Standardized column names.
Performed feature engineering (age groups, customer segments).
Ensured data consistency.

SQL Analysis (MySQL):
Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.
Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions such as:
Revenue by customer segment
Top-performing products
Subscription vs non-subscription behavior
Discount and shipping impact on spending

Power BI Dashboard:
Built an interactive dashboard for business users.
Included KPIs, trends, and filters for easy exploration.
Reporting & Presentation
Created a written report summarizing findings.
Designed a presentation (PPT) in Gamma for stakeholders.

Dashboard:
The Power BI dashboard highlights:
Total revenue and average order value
Customer segmentation analysis
Top categories and products
Subscription and discount insights
Revenue trends by demographics
The dashboard enables dynamic filtering and supports data-driven decision making.
Results & Key Insights
Identified high-value customer segments and loyal buyers.
Highlighted products and categories driving the most revenue.
Analyzed the impact of discounts and subscriptions on spending.
Provided insights to support marketing, pricing, and retention strategies.
